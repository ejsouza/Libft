# Libft C library
As a rule at 42 School we have to code our own libc to get started.
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that I'll be using later on my projects.

`C programming` can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions (at 42 we have access but we are not allowed to use them).
This project makes me rewrite those functions, understand them, and learn to use them.

After finishing this project, I gained a solid understand of the `C programming language`
and how a computer works  under the hood.
